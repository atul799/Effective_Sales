\>>Tell us a little bit about your experience and how you developed your career?

 I graduated here at the University of Sao Paulo. And right after graduation, I joined AmBev as a global management trainee. And throughout all my career, I have had several different experiences as a plant manager, a brewery operations director. I was responsible for the Shared Services Center of AmBev. I was supply people director about ten years ago. And for three years now I have been responsible for people and management as Vice President at AmBev.

\>>could you share with us the main challenge in this process? And more, and how does it relate to incentives and compensation?

Well, the first challenge in my opinion is how to tie both things together. I think that you cannot
talk about incentives and compensation without talking about performance management. So this is, to me, the first challenge. And when establishing the targets, I think that main thing is how to define thing that are relevant for the business. But are measurable and that can relate both to the long-term and to the short-term objectives of your organization.

\>>In this sense, what would you point out as recommendations to apply especially for incentives and
compensation when we are talking about this kind of management?

I think the main recommendation in my opinion is that you need to have incentives that are stretched. How can I say, challenging, but achievable. If your targets are not stretched enough, you won't have the best of your team. You want to achieve the best results that you can. But also, if you have targets that are way too much stretched ortoo much aggressive, you will not be able to engage your team with the targets.

\>> what do you recommend to a sales manager to avoid doing regarding incentives and compensation?

I think that if you have the incentives only related to short-term targets or to internal targets, for instance,
if you only put revenue or sales volume as targets for the compensation, you will not build a long-term
relationship with the clients. And you will not focus on generating value for the client. I think the main thing to avoid is to only look inwards at the organization. I think you need to put your client at the center of the discussions when establishing targets for a team and when defining the compensation model for your team.

\>> What advice would you give to anyone who wants to pursue a sales career?

I would select three things to prioritize. First, put together a great team, I think everything starts with who is with you, and the challenges and objectives that you have. Second one, know your client well. I think that if you know what your client needs, if you know what generates value for him, that it increases the probability of having success in a sales career. And the third one, know your numbers. I think that establishing targets or objectives only based on your feeling and not knowing exactly what are the gaps that you want to close. If it is to increase the number of clients, if it is to increase the sales per client, if it is an increased the portfolio at the clients you already have, I think it's important to know your gaps very well. And to have a good action plan to reach the targets you have established.
