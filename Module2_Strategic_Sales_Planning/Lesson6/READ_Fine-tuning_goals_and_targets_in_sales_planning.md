Abstract

Purpose This article describes an approach to strategy execution using lessons learned from improvement efforts to the sales incentive compensation (SIC) business processes and IT systems in Cisco Systems. Design/methodology/approach This case outlines an alternative approach to strategy execution–a COAR strategy map methodology– illustrated with lessons learned from efforts to improve the sales incentive compensation business processes and IT systems in Cisco Systems.” Findings By following a structured and systematic process, organizations can implement a process for strategy execution that is effective and repeatable. In executing strategy, stay focused on how to translate the decisions taken while defining business strategy into operations. As business strategy changes, elements of the strategy execution must change as well. Research limitations/implications This case is primarily a guide to strategy execution and is not meant to be a prescription for a cutting edge sales compensation plan. Practical implications Although the examples used in this article relate to SIC business processes, the lessons learned can be applied to strategy execution in general. Originality/value It is this “peek forward” into a virtual execution setting, and the opportunity to use it as a scenario-like tool to test alternatives, that increases the likelihood that managers will devise a stable and executable strategy.
