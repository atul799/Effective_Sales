**TOTAL POINTS 15**

1.Question 1

Which of the statements below brings an issue regarding the misalignment of sales and operations?



Salesforce training is not adequately done.



--The conditions to fulfill the delivery are beyond the capacity of the company



The issue comes from a gap of marketing planning process.



The senior management should be directly involved to align the areas



2.Question 2

When a misalignment between sales and operations occurs, the company may have to mobilize additional resources to deliver the order.

Analyze the impacts of such a situation, and choose from the below the statement that best describes a possible impact.



--The sale may not bring the value it could bring, due to the additional costs incurred. And managers may not learn from this process because few of them do a post-mortem analysis.



Salespeople will learn from the situation, and the possibility of occurring the same situation in the future will be reduced.



The operations professionals will have a bonus if they manage to deliver the order on time and with the specified quality.



The operations area will improve their processes because they'll learn how to tackle these situations.



3.Question 3

If company's managers decide to incur an additional expense, to comply with a delivery time that is above the capacity of a regular business structure, then what is the learning insight that salespeople will have?



Operations area will have difficulty in improving their regular throughput, due to the excess of workload that they'll have to tackle because of this kind of demand.



--All the alternatives are correct.



The company will not improve in the overall regular business operations because the staff will be focusing too much on the contingencies, and not in analyzing and developing improvements to the regular operations.



They might understand that this procedure is a possibility with some availability, which might lead them to think the operations area is capable of dealing with these situations.



4.Question 4

What should be done in case the company has to make additional efforts to tackle a lead-time issue?



Operations area should abort the efforts to serve as a pedagogical case for the sales area.



The company should have a contingency team to absorb these extra load of work.



There's no best way to deal with such a situation. Therefore the company should establish a rule that no order should be accepted if the lead-time is potentially overdue.



==Managers should make efforts to categorize what the issues are and analyze a priority order to tackle each of the issues



5.Question 5

Why do salespeople tend to overlook the integration of strategy, marketing, and sales?



Because sales area's managers don't have to be worried about strategy. Their job is to sell.



Because the senior management of the company has the responsibility to analyze strategic guidelines and interpret them to design the transition to the other areas of the company.



Because at the business unit level, the sales area is too operational to be involved in this process.



--Because the interpretation process applied to the strategic guidelines of the company is a complex matter. It may be clear at the strategic level; however, at the business unit level, it may need a better connection with the products and services portfolio.



6.Question 6

The statement: "Executives analyze the strategic guidelines and assess what alternatives to consider and develop in more details to support the definition of the business level strategy", meansâ€¦:



--This is the process that supports the alignment and integration of corporate level strategy to the business unit level strategy.



The statement means that the strategy is something that is too far away from the radar of the sales area.



It means that at the business unit level, executives may define the objectives without consulting managers of the different areas of the company.



It means senior executives adopt the top-down approach for the strategy roll-out in the company.



7.Question 7

"Read this statement below:

At the corporate level strategy, some of the objectives relate to cash flow and earnings, which leads corporate executives to establish goals such as EBITDA margin, expected cash flow or earnings per share.

Choose the alternative that represents a natural consequence that emerges from the application of the statement above."



The application of the statement above is not possible at the business unit level because the goals are too broad.



--The goals mentioned in the statement are general financial indicators, and they can be achieved by a series of programs, projects, and actions at the business unit level.



The statement implies the senior management has to apply a top-down approach to the strategy implementation.



The consequence of the application of what the statement says is that executives at the business unit level have just to comply with the goals and execute the strategy.



8.Question 8

How does the connection between the corporate level strategy to sales planning materialize?



--It materializes through the revenue of the business unit (the company).



It materializes through what managers want to be implemented.



At the corporate level, the connection to sales planning is also established by the professionals who develop the strategic guidelines. That's how the connection is built.



It materializes through what the external environment becomes during the fiscal year.



9.Question 9

What should managers do to operationalize sales planning in an integrated approach to corporate strategy?



They should follow what the strategic guidelines are.



--Managers should estimate the revenue level that aligns with the corporate strategy. Then, they would drill-down the aggregated revenue to each of the products and services of the company's portfolio.

Sales executives should participate in the corporate strategy analysis and definition.



10.Question 10

In case a strategic guideline defines a target EBITDA margin, what should sales managers analyze?



They should support the plan that comes from the corporate level.



-->Managers would design the transition from the corporate level strategy to the business level by looking at the revenue and the costs to serve customers.



Managers should plan sales according to what the strategic guidelines defined in the strategy analysis outcomes.



Managers should analyze taxes and financial expenses.



11.Question 11

Consider you're a sales manager responsible for negotiating goals for your sales team. The corporate managers give you an aggregate target of sales revenue to achieve. Which of the alternatives best describes a recommended approach?



What aspects of the sales revenue have you analyzed to conclude that it's a feasible objective?



You question the corporate managers what's the drilled down of the target revenue to do a feasibility analysis.



--You have made a structured analysis and concluded that the aggregate sales revenue budget is challenging, though feasible. And, your team members would be able to achieve the revenue goals according to the drilled-down numbers because the ramp-up of sales revenue would be timely achievable.



You have assessed how to measure the results from sales, regarding the aggregated revenue and also the drilled-down revenue per product lines or per sales rep depending on how the company structure the results analysis.



12.Question 12

What does Timely-related or Timely-achievable stand for, in the context of a SMART indicator associated with a goal to achieve?



-->It means that the goal to achieve can actually be achieved in the time specified to be achieved.



It means the indicator can be measured in the time specified to be measured.



It means the frequency to measure the results is adequate to the structure of the sales area.



It means the goal is adequately challenging to be achieved.



13.Question 13

We are used to hearing that companies that can put their customers in the center of their business objectives present better performance.

Which of the statements below reflect this phenomenon?



--Balancing customers' and company's interests means company's managers have chosen target customers, and they were chosen based on the potential benefits for both sides.



The phenomenon supports salespeople to propose that the other areas of the company should support sales area in all demands.



The phenomenon is plausible, provided that managers have been able to balance customers' interests with company's interests, by identifying which ones are the most beneficial for the sell-side (for the company that is the seller).



The phenomenon is more of a statement than reality because it pushes the salesforce to use it as an argument to negotiate more benefits to the customers than the company could afford.



14.Question 14

In the discussion of Lesson 7, regarding ethical leadership, it's been proposed that there's a positive relationship between ethical leadership and salespeople commitment to providing superior customer value.

Which of the statements below would be recommended to apply, due to this proposition?



Superior customer value comes at a cost, which is the supplier company value reduces in such a situation.



If there's no direct relation between ethical leadership and superior value to the supplier (seller) company, then maybe ethical leadership is not a recommended approach.



--An ethical leadership tends to contribute to building trust with customers, which enhances the possibilities of creating more value for the company. In such a situation, customers also have a share in the increased value.



The focus of the leadership should be on selling. Sometimes ethical leadership can limit sales potential.

Also, they need to double-check the link between the objectives of the company and the value proposition for the customers. Finally, they need to make choices regarding what capabilities the company should support to achieve the objectives.



Managers of each of different areas should focus on their respective areas responsibilities because it's too much time consuming to keep attention to other areas.
