\>> Talking about experience, you have an extensive commercial cover year. Could you share one of episode that you have leveraged regarding sales team?

 I started at the camp manager position in American company and after a while, I had a team of 18 people working with me. The most in challenging episode, it was to make the whole team sales and system understand the importance of each other on the entire ecosystem. The only way that it was really clear to them to understand this was doing analogy with The Lion King cartoon. Lion King? The cartoon? Yes, the cartoon, The Lion King. 

\>>Why? 

The goal of every living being in The Lion King is to eat, from the lion to the hyena. And it's clear through all the food chain. If the lion does not succeed in their hunt, nobody will eat.  In the company ecosystem is the same thing, but the goal is the revenue. But if the system does not succeed selling, there is no workload for logistic, system, IT. So, the pressure and responsibility of the sales team is amazing. And at that time, if you don't achieve 80 percent of your quota in two years in a row, then you find someone that will do. So this was really challenging. 

\>>What is the most critical factor of success in leading and motivating sales teams? 

Well, the leader is like to be a king. The team must work for you, but the difference is how they will do so. The brave king will inspire the knights and they will follow them because they will enjoy putting their swords at service. The most critical factor of success, in my point of view, is to inspire your team. You must be accessible to the team and always have a good energy, mainly related to the business. Is this easy? Is it possible to do it everyday? The inspire leader will always find a way. 

\>>In this sense, what would you recommend to a new sales manager to apply considering sales force development? 

Well, to develop the sales force, it is very important you know where to go. So, you must study very well the market you are going, the size, competition, challenges, and also seasonabilities. 

\>>We're talking about salespeople development. But in general, leading sales force is much more than this. What would you recommend to a new sales manager regarding leadership?

The idea of leadership in sales force, in any industry, the new sales manager must understand the business and it is desirable that he had rather be in the sales field. This experience will be the key to gain a team trust in this new challenge. 

\>>Well, based on your experience, what advice would you give to anyone who wants to build a successful sales career? 

Well, just sell something, is a gift that everybody has inside. Some people are natural, other have to work a bit more. But everybody is selling their ideas, point of views, and needs to achieve their goals. Once someone challenge yourself to develop the sales career, you must believe in yourself, believe in what you're selling, and never, never, never give up.
