\>>tell us a little bit about yourself and your experience.
 I'm the head of sales for IP and optical networks for a Nokia covering all of the Latin America region.

\>>share some special situation that you face during
all your career as a head for this important region, Latin America.

I have my career not only in Latin America, but also in Europe,sometime in Germany. But, especially here in Latin America,we have some big customers that demand almost billions of contracts. And one of the most important that I have managed was a big outsourcing deal with a customer in Brazil that was a five years contract that you need to prepare. Your team and also your structure to start a project that will last as long as you plan. And the good experience,that when defining sales start, why do you want to achieve,
what do you want to achieve with that. It's easy if you know the customer and can really understand their demands, not what he's writing that he wants, but what he really needs that you can offer, what is good, and achieve the targets that you have set for your team.

\>>Could you share with us the main challenge to establish goals and targets to your sales team? 

One point that's very challenging, it's that you always need to grow the business.  This is the most important, there is no business that you can be flat. Nobody accepts that. Especially, in big structures, that means you need to improve the amount of sales, and you need to improve the profitability that you have in the project. And these are the two main challenges that you have to balance, because sometimes you have ups and downs in projects, and you need to manage that. But, the final target, that is to increase the numbers, is to their end to be achieved. And for the guys that who are starting sales, you must be prepared. Nobody accepts that you go down with the numbers. 

\>> Are there any particular aspects that you'd recommend doing regarding goals and targets to finish? Do you have any specific recommendations to be aware in this specific time?
I think that there are two conditions that you need analyze. One is do not overstretch. That means make realistic targets because if you overstretch, then you'll be followed by a number that you are not going to achieve. And second, also do not go on a comfort zone. Because if you go in a comfort zone, it will be very difficult to achieve the numbers. Then try to stretch a bit, but realistic, and push the team to do more. I think to avoid and setting target, sometimes, you cannot avoid because they will be top-down.

\>>  What do you give to anyone who wants to pursue and develop a sales career?
Good sales career, it's about handling with people. It doesn't matter if it's a company that's your customer, but behind this customer there is a someone there, there is people. And you need to manage there. To be prepared you need to understand what these guys need, what the company that he works for needs. But what motivates them to do a decision in your direction. I think this is one important point, that you know the people that you are handling with. Second, that you know your portfolio very well. And third, that you know the market, and you can handle and counter-attack moves that your market, or your other companies, your market are doing, that make you successful. Three points, people, portfolio, and market.
