Alexandre Seraphim. 



have more than 20 years experience working for multinational companies, basically European and American companies. And background is in engineering  and got  MBA from Warwick University.

At a certain point in my career, I had a boss. I was doing my career development in sales and marketing but, this boss came to me and said, "Look Alex, if you want to be an executive, a manager in the company, you better understand more finance." Finance. "You should work in finance for some time." And then, I was offered a job in finance. I took this step, and was really important for my long term development.



\>>Considering your professional career and experience having directing the finance, marketing and sales areas, you have brought experience to evaluate the results from the relationship between these areas. What are the adverse effects of misalignment in the relationship and lack of integration between the areas to achieve these strategic objectives?

I think that the business environment is becoming increasingly more and more complex.  It's not possible to think that business is in silos, in separate areas. The strategy nowadays of any company, any sector has to adopt a more disciplinary approach. A company that doesn't pursue this type of approach and keeps working in silos and dividing areas, finance here, sales there, marketing there, is going to fail. Those type of companies, they are not going to be successful. Because it's very likely they are not going to make the best options on allocating resources for example, but probably its competitor will do. It's critical that there are alignments between finance, sales, marketing, all areas, for the sake of competitive advantage. 

\>>Given your experience, probably you face many confrontational situations between finance and sales area. What is the most frequent reason for conflict between these two specific areas? 

It's true. The most typical situation of conflict comes from the focus eachother has. Normally, finance is going to be more focused on **bottom line or profitability.** And, finance also tends to be more risky adverse. On the other hand, salespeople, they are thinking about growth, they're thinking about top line, they take more risk, and also the environment that they work's different. The sales people, they are in the front line with customers, and finance people, they are more knowledgeable, they are in the back office. Because of apparently differences, you can see in some case, some level of conflict. 



\>>In the same way, have you experienced any of these conflicts, these that you told us? And, how did you work to correct and eliminate these conflicts? 

I think that certain level of tension is not bad. But, the conflict doesn't need to be necessarily confrontational. It can be constructive. It can be a positive. At the end of the day, finance and sales, they have the same objective. But it's natural that they have different perspectives. How you should do this, you should work together, complimentary vision. I think that salespeople, they should incorporate some financial concepts, such as return on investment. Everything that the company do has to have a return in a certain time. Finance people and salespeople, they can cooperate and work in partnership. And have the same common objectives. We can talk about very common situations that you've seen day by day in the company. Sales normally, pricing, commercial discourse, something that is part of your day by day when you would negotiate with customers. Yes, of course. And sales think, "Look, we need to drive up sales. " And, commercial discount, for example, is one of the tools that you use. Investment, of course, is another tool. It's not necessarily a conflict with finance. It depends on the time horizon and the strategy of the company. Everything starts with a clear strategy, clear direction, and common objectives. 

\>>Did you consider that this conflict is too common?

Very much indeed. Because of globalization, competition, they are not anymore competing with another company in a local marketplace. I see. In the 21st century, all the companies, they are competing to all firms everywhere. It has to do about globalization, technology change, changing very fast, and also the professionals. The professionals, they are becoming much more better educated. The companies which can take advantage of all those elements, they're going to be more successful. And, this is a challenge also for us as a professionals. This tension, it is too present. And, will increase because of technology, globalization. But on the other hand, what we can see is a change also in the culture and in the mindset of the professionals to become more open, to not consider more these things about a silo. It's an old stuff. No, you cannot work in silos anymore. There is a big change in the culture of the company. It's a big change in the mindset, but a lot of work to be done. I think that when we talk about leadership, it's not only top down, it's also from bottom up and lateral. **I think that there is one thing that is very important for the new sales managers, that they take the lead, they're pro-active, and they engage. They engage in two directions. They need to learn we finance people about financial concepts. And, they have to do also the engagement of finance people in their areas, and bring them, to visit with them, go to the field together, go to visit some customers, also to provide their perspective. But this's the type of thing that requires a lot of pro activeness and positive attitude. ** 



\>> In this sense, what advice would you give to anyone who wants to pursue a sales career? 

I think that we can never forget that competition is outside of the company. You need to see your colleagues from other areas as your business partner. Attitude is as important as knowledge so you need to be proactive. And, if you want to be understood, you need to understand others. I would advise you to try to engage finance people, bring them to the field, go and visit customers with them, so they can understand more about what you do. But you should do the other way around as well. You should try to incorporate finance concepts. This is key. This is key for the career development of any one.
