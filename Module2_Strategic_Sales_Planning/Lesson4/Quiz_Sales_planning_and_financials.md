## Strategic Sales Planning

**TOTAL POINTS 6**

1.Question 1

"Salespeople have just to sell". What should a sales manager ask herself/himself after hearing this quote?



Where do I sign-off this document?



--Ok, but is there anyone in the company managing the financial aspects?



OK, but how can I be sure nobody is going to blame me for the financial problems if any will occur?



Yes! Why should I care about financials if the incentive programs are already in place?

**Comment: A sales managers should take care about the financials because, at the bottom line, the contribution of sales should create value, not destroy.**

2.Question 2

Whenever you see a sales incentive program based on physical goals, you should:



Adopt them as your targets and work hard to achieve them.



Question the numbers because they're always based on a push to achieve something you can't achieve.



Negotiate the pace of the goals achievement during each period of sales performance measurement.



--Double-check that the financial aspects were analyzed to establish the thresholds of the program.

**Comment:Physical goals don't show the whole picture of the sales performance. A sales manager should care about the financial numbers too.**

3.Question 3

Regarding management information systems and sales goals and targets: Which of the options IS NOT a recommendation that you should follow?



Check if the data from the system is timely available - in the sense that whenever you need it, you have it.



Check the applicability of the data available in the system.



Always take time to analyze the data with an eye on the reliability aspect.



--Trust on the data because you don't have time to waste. Your goal is to sell.

**Comment:This recommendation is not wise because the sales area professionals should care about the quality of the information.**

4.Question 4

Why is credit policy so relevant for the sales area?



--That's because it's not only about applying it as a negotiable instrument with the customer. It's about the value creation for the company.



Because a tight credit policy doesn't allow me to achieve my goals.



Because credit policy is one factor that takes salesforce out of the comfort zone, and this is a priority to make them mobilize to perform at higher levels



It's not relevant because the company can accommodate some flexibility in credit to customers

**Comment: Credit policy will eventually influence the rhythm of cash flow, and that means value creation at higher or lower level.**

5.Question 5

In the reading material, there's a sentence that seems to be miswritten. It says "managers should permanently be evaluating the results with regard the results. Otherwise, the company may lose money."

If it's not miswritten, what does it mean?



It means the results may be wrong due to the management information system unreliability.



It means that people don't speak the same language within a company.



--It means results can be categorized, and many times salespeople's results are considered as being of a different category by salespeople, compared to how finance people may categorize the same results.



It means managers overlook the results most of the times.

**Comment:Results are perceived differently depending on where the analyst work in the company. And because of this characteristic, sometimes the value creation to the company is not achieved due to the differences in point of views.**

6.Question 6

Can a salesperson sleep well at night without knowing if she/he is adding value to the company?



It's hard to understand the concept of value creation. So, why worry about it?



This is not a salespeople's problem. This is a finance people's problem.



--Yes. If she/he is a frontline salesperson, maybe there'd be no problem at all. However, if she/he is in a sales managing position, then sleeping well under this condition should not be happening.



A salesperson doesn't have to worry about value creation.

**Comment: A frontline salesperson wouldn't have to care much about value creation, though it would be nice to have some concerns regarding it. On the other hand, a sales manager should care a lot about this subject.**
