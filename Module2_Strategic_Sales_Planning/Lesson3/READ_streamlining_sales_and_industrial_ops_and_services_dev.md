**Streamlining Sales with Industrial Operations and Services Development**



The issue of streamlining sales function with industrial or services operations is a classic challenge that must be addressed, whatever is the segment of the company.

The sales function has a vital role in this process, and so has the operations area.

Why is it important? That's because any misalignment between sales and operations leads the company to lose money. As simple as that. The misalignment may be materialized in many ways, and in this text, some of them will be discussed.

Every sales professional has been through or will be through a situation that he/she needs to mobilize resources to tackle this challenge.

Have you experienced a situation like this? For example, salesperson closes a negotiation with a particular customer; however, the conditions to fulfill the delivery are beyond the capacity of the company. The situation described is another serious conflict between sales and other areas of the company.

You might have had the insight that this situation is not rare, just the opposite. Talking to people of different segments of the economy, we can realize that most of them have more than one case to describe. And in the conversation with these people, typically some phrases and expressions may emerge, like for example:

**“Salespeople have to sell!", some people are used to say.**

**"Salespeople have to sell what the company can deliver at a given level of quality”;** other people might say.

Do you remember the discussion on marketing and sales conflict? The war (or peace) between marketing and sales may represent a similar situation of the subject in discussion here.

One classic phrase that some of the marketing people are used to say about salespeople is:

**"Overpaid order takers who will promise almost anything to get the business!"**.¹ To counterbalance, with a different angle of analysis, through the salespeople’s vision, take the example of a phrase that some salespeople might say about marketing people: **"tower big-picture people with no clue as to what customers need! ".**

Can you imagine industrial or services operations people having similar dissonance with salespeople? Probably yes. Sales is an important function to make the value flow through from the supplier to the buyer. However, this process is performed by many different areas of the company, and operations is a vital area.

Typically, the structure of the operations is designed to deliver a specified service level agreement. That means the company has established ranges of operations, so that the manufacturing of products, service development and delivery of all items have limits. In some cases, customers demand a different lead time to have access to the products or services. And depending on what is the timeline of the customer, the sale opportunity is presented in a short window. And in this window, the supplier company salesperson might push the company to capture the opportunity.

This approach is not wrong, in the sense that business operations have to accommodate some of the dynamics of demand changes. The challenge is that sometimes the aggregate demand surpasses the capacity of the supplier to take all orders. And, either by some limitations in the management information system or by the decision of the salespeople, the company may have to make an extra effort to deliver the products or services to the customers.

So, the issue under discussion here is the misalignment of sales function and the company's operations.

Whenever this misalignment occurs, managers have to tackle the challenges caused by it, which may include:

-Mobilizing additional resources to deliver the order;

-Paying an extra fee to comply with a delivery time that is above the capacity of a regular business

structure

\- And even changing procedures in the operations that cost a lot regarding machinery setup or delaying production of regular products of the portfolio.

The impacts can be so many, and the discussion of each one would take a lot of time. The idea of this text is to highlight the issue, and propose approaches to tackle the problem and mitigate the consequences. Most companies have contingency programs to keep a minimum flexibility, and thus being able to temporarily adjust the operations level to fulfill the demand in such specific contexts.

We'll talk about three topics that may demand extra care.



**Lead-time challenge**

One typical issue regarding this subject under discussion is the lead­ time. A typical question that a customer makes is regarding when your company can deliver the ordered products or services.

Most salespeople check with operations area if the company can deliver at an expected time. And they do it before closing the deal. At least, they should do it, as a recommendation for good practices.

However, the perfect world is something that doesn't exist.

Problems of communication, lack of adequate training, management information systems issues or even a plain old-fashioned misunderstanding of parameters and products or services attributes can lead to a gap between what the customer expects and what the company can deliver.

If this is the case, managers should make efforts to categorize what the issues are and analyze a priority order to tackle each of the issues. Some adjustments may be possible to provide the needed flexibility.

A good approach to do it is to recurrently discuss this matter in the budget planning process because during this activity there's more integration between sales and operations managers. Every time a multifunctional meeting is in place is an excellent moment to share information, establish a relationship, and define the business operational thresholds in which the company can flexibly operate.

Salespeople should know the lead times for each item of the company's portfolio.



**Product or service scope misalignment**

Have you seen customers trying to explain that the scope of the solution delivered is not in alignment to what was agreed in the negotiation process?

Probably yes! But if you haven't had this experience so far, be aware that you may have this experience in the future.

This situation is a classical one that occurs, especially in companies that provide services in specialized professional expertise areas.

Again, the sources of the problem may be communication issues, lack of training, attributes and parameters misunderstanding, and even some information exchange limitation between customers and sales representatives.

One way to avoid this problem is to invest in salespeople training. Most of the issues can be prevented by having well-prepared salespeople.

Remember also that the discussion is about services provided, which involves many intangible aspects that are challenging to communicate to customers. Talk to people of the operations area, they know what they can or cannot do.

If the company can't deliver what most of the customers demand, then maybe it's time to involve marketing and operations people to reorganize the company’s operations. In such a program, managers adjust the portfolio, they develop and launch new offerings with improved service level agreements terms.

Whatever the actions may be, try to take them in advance, to avoid having to mitigate the consequences of a gap between what was sold and what was expected by the customer.

Any effort that addresses this issue is not a wasted time. The company’s operations may improve a lot, and by consequence, the whole competitiveness may position the company in an upgraded performance.



**The sales quotas issue**

A source of a problem regarding the misalignment between what is sold and what the customer expects is the performance management model, which is related to the sales quotas. Sometimes salespeople sell solution A instead of B because their quota for A hasn't been achieved yet. And some of the customers who have bought solution A, needed solution B instead of A.

Analyze if this is not the case of your company. This situation occurs when managers establish goals based on volumes, units sold or contracts closed. Goals based on physical numbers demand critical analysis before the definition of the targets.

Whenever this happens, a double­ check on the misalignment between what customers expect and what salespeople sell is needed.

Chances of this situation happening increase when physical quotas are in place.

This discussion would take hours if done with details. For more about this subject, see the references.

We have seen in this session the issue regarding streamlining sales function with industrial and services operations.
