\>>With this experience and responsibility, in your vision, what is the biggest challenge for
a head of projects and service regarding the alignment of corporate strategy and the specific strategies of the area? 

I think the biggest challenge is to obtain the desire and needed service level. To achieve the corporate goals in customer satisfaction, which is very important. And as part of these challenges, the next step faced by the service area, is to maintain these service standards at the level of excellence. This is as important, and as tough, as establishing manufacturing and services standards, and obtain to them in the first place, especially in service. There are two approaches that any organization can have powers to maintain services standards, a **proactive and a reactive approach**. I would say that **proactive approach is
a dynamic approach entails actively reaching out to the customer, and trying to gather the feedback on service quality, suggesting the areas of improvement**. The **reactive approach mainly
consists of resorting to a proposal service, recovery mechanism, also customer complains about
the poor service quality or results**.

\>>Now, putting all together, what is the biggest challenge to align, sales and manufacturing service process?

There are few challenges, but I would say that the biggest challenge is to have sales manufacturing in service support work integrated, not in parallel.  One big mistake is that many companies treats sales manufacturing in service support as independent operations. They see the customer journey as a straight line. Or the customers comes into contact with the business, purchases a products, and only seeks help from service support when any issues arise and came up. So this narrow view ignores the value of the customers and misses out in the opportunity to create a long term relationship. So with this relationship, they should renew, they will renew, add equipment, and potentially add features and enhancements to the existing equipment, generating more business to the company.

\>>In this sense, what are the most common mistakes made during the sales planning process that should be avoid considering manufacturing and services area?

A frequent mistake is setting targets that would not be possible to achieve due to the limitations of
the installation and service units. Also setting realistic expectations to your customer, and I would say that also is log-tracking.  Which you can't improve what you don't measure.

\>>Based that on your experience, what advice would you give to anyone who wants to pursue a sales career? 

I like to play with the do and don't phrases. So I would say, **do value your customers' trust**

**Don't oversell your product or services*

**Do pay special attention to timeframes.**

**Do practice seamless communication. **

And most importantly,
**don't make impossible promises. **
