**Sales Planning: Integration with Corporate Strategy**



It's been discussed before the relevance of integrating strategies involving the company, the marketing and sales functions.

This integration is a topic that presents some probability to be overlooked by salespeople. And among the causes of it **is the interpretation process applied on the strategic guidelines of the company. The transition from the strategic guidelines to the business unit strategy is a complex matter, and it's one of the top responsibilities of executives.**

In this process, **executives analyze the strategic guidelines and assess what alternatives to consider and develop in more details to support the definition of the business level strategy.** In other words, this process is precisely the alignment and integration of corporate level strategy to the business unit level strategy, which includes objectives of cash generation, earnings for the company. In alignment to this procedure, managers at the business unit level will define the revenue budget that matches the expected earnings at the corporate level. And here is the connection between the corporate level strategy and the business unit level strategy.

It's not hard to see the picture, **the revenue budget at the business unit level is the guideline at this level, and it serves as the reference to the planning process. Eventually, managers will interact with the marketing and sales areas managers to define the goals and targets, and these targets are at the level of each product or service within the company's portfolio.**

As for the bridge between the strategy at the corporate level and the business unit level, it's good to start looking at the strategic guidelines side. Most of the topics discussed are related to the corporate goals of the company.

And these goals relate to the medium to long-term time horizon. Ideally, the goals should be aligned with the strategic guidelines, and in most cases they are. At the end of this process, the programs and projects will be rolled-out with a vision of the long-term objectives of the company.

**These objectives give the direction of the company; they support the changes necessary to improve company's value creation; they also proportionate the discussion of the pipeline of new products, and they define the strategic issues that company’s managers should address for the next years to come.**

By consequence, one of the effects of the corporate strategy integration at the business unit level is the mobilization to improve the potential of profit and cash generation.

Therefore, at the corporate level strategy, some of the objectives relate to cash flow and earnings, which leads corporate executives to establish goals such as EBITDA margin, expected cash flow or earnings per share. They are predominantly broad financial goals, which is expected at the corporate level.

These goals are general financial indicators that can be achieved by a series of programs, projects, and actions at the business unit level.

These programs and projects lead executives to establish primary revenue goals at the business level.

Revenue comes from product and services sales, and here is the link between corporate strategy and sales. The connection of the corporate level strategy to sales planning materializes through the revenue expected for the business unit (the company).

So, in summary, the subject under discussion is how to operationalize the alignment of sales planning to the corporate strategy.

From a prescriptive view on the subject, the marketing function can support the link between strategy and sales functions. And it's done by integrating strategy, marketing, and sales to generate a seamless strategy-to-sales plan.

One important step of this integration is the sales planning process.

When asked about how to integrate sales to strategy, most people would say that it's basically through the sales revenues. The analysis presented in this reading material corroborates this understanding, which means, managers plan the expected revenue, accordingly to the corporate strategic guidelines, and then the sales planning should include all discussions about programs and projects that could support achieving the expected revenue level. And this process goes at the products and services level.

Therefore, to operationalize sales planning in an integrated approach to corporate strategy, managers should estimate the revenue level that aligns with the corporate strategy. Then, they would drill-down the aggregated revenue to each of the products and services of the company's portfolio.

For example, as exemplified before, the strategic guideline could set a goal for the EBITDA margin.

As it’s a margin indicator, managers would design the transition from the corporate level strategy to the business level by looking at the revenue and the costs. At this point, they'd go through the sales planning process.

Sales planning processes would focus on the relationship between revenue and costs to serve, for example, by defining the sales incentives program.

Of course, there are other factors to analyze, such as the cost of goods sold, administrative expenses, capital expenditures, working capital needs, and financial expenses.

These topics would be managed by different areas of the company, like production, operations, finance, engineering, and marketing.

Specifically, for sales area, the items to be addressed are the incentives program, pricing, discount policy, traveling costs, and also the additional attributes that would, or would not make part of the solution offered to customers.

A similar rationale would apply in the case of expected cash flow at the corporate level. In this case, managers would be analyzing the potential of revenue generation.

And since revenue is the consequence of products and services sold to customers, the transition between corporate strategy and sales planning is intuitive and straightforward in this case.

By the conclusion, in the sales planning process, managers would be estimating the volumes or amounts of products and services necessary to achieve the aggregated revenue goal.

Estimation of revenue is a typical process of the sales and marketing planning process, and it materializes through the budget planning process.

The corporate planning process has to be developed with attention because this is the best process to develop a reliable connection between corporate strategy and sales planning.

That's how the sales planning process integrates to the corporate strategy.
