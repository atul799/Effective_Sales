**Why selling once won’t cut it anymore**



The Key Account Management philosophy allows the customers to perceive the suppliers’ commitment to their success. Clients understand how beneficial an increased cooperation allows the suppliers to understand the client's situation and the business context better.

As a result, the suppliers can respond to the customer’s need faster and more precisely. Also, many of the suppliers may also share the costs and risks of developing and launching new products and services. An increased participation and joint development of products and services also reduce the need to exchange suppliers, thus reducing uncertainties and all of the associated costs.

The main effect on the supplier base is that changes in suppliers happen more sporadically, so the account executives can spend their time and effort in understanding the clients and their needs, instead of looking for new clients.

With the expectation of having a long-term relationship with clients the suppliers become more willing to make longer-term investments to serve clients better, and the focus of the relationship between clients and suppliers is the ability to serve the client’s needs, technical and operational capacity. Price is neither the only nor the primary concern.

The Key Account Management model is the exact opposite of unique sales.

The main characteristic of this model is that the main consideration is price, and there is no loyalty on either side. The success of this model depends on the supplier's ability to develop a business model and value chain that is fully geared to low-cost operation, including process technology, standardized product design, to generate economies of scale, standardized and automated operation, Low labor costs etc.

Most companies do not have the necessary factors to ensure the sustainability of this model, and will succeed only until a competitor arrives with lower prices.

Building a long-term relationship is not easy; it requires effort and a real commitment from both parts. It is important to choose the customers with whom the firm will interact in the coming years, and this requires a strong strategic analysis capability applied to sales. This is the topic of the next course, Sales Strategy.

In the next course, we will describe how Competitive Intelligence can be used to help companies to make better decisions. These tools are typically used to support strategic analysis, but they can also be used to identify and understand current and potential clients enough to help deciding the best way to interact with the client is and how to best serve its needs.

The success of the **Customer Centric Sales**, which is sometime materialized in the form of **Key Account Management model** depend on clients willingness to set up long term relationships, and abandon the behavior of focusing only in price.

You will still find companies willing to put as much pressure as possible on the suppliers, as a way to squeeze the suppliers into offering lower prices, and possibly making bad deals. These companies should not be at the top of the priority list. Strategy means saying yes to some option and saying no to all others.

The analytical tools presented in Course 2 will help you to find potential clients willing to establish a collaborative relationship that generates more value to all involved. They are also useful when trying to figure out how to better deal with companies in the market.
