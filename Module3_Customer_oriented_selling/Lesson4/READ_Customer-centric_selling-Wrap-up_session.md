**Customer-centric selling wrap-up**



This module was important because it allowed us to explore the conceptual basis for Customer Centric Selling, its advantages and how it is different from traditional sales. We also had the chance to examine one of the ways this concept can be materialized.

At this point, you probably realized how a model like the Key Account Management is the natural consequence of an increasingly more aggressive competitive environment that is both cause and consequence of a process of concentration that affect both customers and suppliers.

The competitive pressure will continue to increase. Companies will adapt or disappear. Conquering and maintaining customers will demand more efforts and skills from all of the people involved.

That means our companies will be different. People of our companyâ€™s internal areas will need to learn how to cooperate, work together, share knowledge under the coordination of individuals whose job is to build and maintain healthy, long relationships with clients.

Clients' professionals will also need to change. As they need more and more support from their supply base, they will need to share information on plans and initiatives to have access to the knowledge and experience of suppliers.

New relationships, based on trust, cooperation will require a high degree of qualification, and technical, human, and commercial skills.

On the next course of this specialization - Course 2, which is Sales Strategy, you will find some of the tools and techniques recommended to perform several kinds of analyses to help you improve the understanding of the industry and its components. Some of these tools are regularly used to support strategic planning, but they are extremely effective in helping sales efforts.

These tools, when well-used, can support the generation of insights you need to help your business and your customers.
