## Graded quiz: Customer oriented selling

**TOTAL POINTS 11**

1.Question 1

Unique sales:



--Are no longer adequate, because this kind of transaction create no loyalty, as transactions are based mostly on prices, and there is no real relationship between the parts.



Are no longer adequate because, in practice, any product and service will more than likely become a commodity in the future.



Are the only way to make sure Capitalism works, therefore should continue the primary form of interaction between companies.



Are no longer adequate, because high volume transaction generates more bargaining power to the buyer.



2.Question 2

The main advantage of the Key Account Management philosophy is:



--Alignment. Clients and suppliers perceive the same competitive environment, therefore move in the same direction, allowing a lower response time and the development of a tailored solution to the client's problems.



Bargaining power. Since clients have more information on the suppliers, the clients can negotiate the most convenient conditions.



Price - the Key Account Management can guarantee lower prices than individual sales because the suppliers do not waste time and energy in solutions that can be used in multiple clients.



Speed - Since the client decides what the suppliers will do, both clients and suppliers can save time.



3.Question 3

Customer Centric Sales changes the relationship between companies because:



Suppliers agree not to integrate forward, and are content to provide products and services to support customers;



--Suppliers help customers achieve their goals and abandon traditional tactics of making presentations to convince customers in each sales interaction.



Suppliers help customers achieve their goals because customers are larger than them, so they have greater bargaining power.



Suppliers realize the economic and financial advantages of concentrating only on one activity;



4.Question 4

In the case of competition between Coca-Cola and Pepsico, suppliers need to understand the competitive dynamics because:



Find ways to increase your bargaining power when negotiating with two competing companies.



Selling to both companies by proposing strategies for the player that the current supplier knows will be useful against their competitor - which is also this supplier's client.



--Develop products more suited to the needs of the customer (or customers) they decide to meet.



Sell to both companies by offering the same solutions - this way reducing development costs.



5.Question 5

In the Key Account Management system, the role of the account manager is:



--Develop and execute the strategic plan, and mobilize the resources to make it happens as planned, using a standardized template for all accounts.



Establish and maintain the relationship with the customer because the account manager must never forget that he is essentially a salesperson.



Develop and execute the strategic plan, and mobilize the resources to make it happen as planned, using a template tailored to the unique needs of the client.



Establish and maintain the customer relationship because customer contact is too important to be done by less prepared people than the account manager.



6.Question 6

In the Key Account Management model, the reason the information should be:



--Available to all people with an operational need to know: no more, no less, no earlier and not later than needed, to prevent information leakage, voluntary and involuntary.



Freely distributed to all people within the organization. This strategy is better to foster openness. Also, when people have access to the full information, the big picture, they can contribute more.



Available to all people with an operational need to know: no more, no less, no earlier and not later than needed, because it is very difficult to find reliable people.



Freely distributed to all people within the organization. This strategy is better to foster openness. The argument of information security does not make sense: if the employee is not reliable, he/she should be fired.



7.Question 7

In the Key Account Management, the importance of Corporate Compliance is that:



--Company's employees need to comply with the rules and regulations. The model assumes the clients will share proprietary and confidential information to your company's personnel, and the information needs to be protected.



It has become an obligation for any company willing to become a supplier of a larger company, therefore it is rational for suppliers to set up their Compliance areas to be able to compete for the best business opportunities.



The suppliers are taking a more active role in product development. If the client has a good Compliance area, and there is a problem with the product, the client will most certainly try and deflect some of the responsibility for the supply chain, and the suppliers need to defend themselves.



It reduces the value of fines if one employee does not do the Correct thing. In several cases, the mere fact the company demonstrated the existence of a functional Compliance Area was enough to reduce the amount of fines paid.



8.Question 8

In the Key Account Management model, sometimes the contract demands that a firewall between the teams working for competing clients. That demand:



Makes sense because suppliers should avoid providing products and services for business that compete with each other.



Does not make sense, because the new economy is based on communication.



Does not make sense, because in a company people talk, and information will inevitably leak out in a very short time.



--Makes sense because it protects the information of both manufacturers.



9.Question 9

The Customer Centric Selling model meets a need for greater specialization of companies, which begin to transfer non-core activities to partners and suppliers. One of the most important effects of this trend is:



--Suppliers, who in this model behave more and more similar to partners, need to offer increasingly complex solutions to their customers/partners.



Clients will start asking for more and more support from their suppliers/customers, so each supplier must develop internal systems that ensure that information from one industry does not pass to another industry.



Clients will start asking for more and more support from their suppliers/customers, so each supplier must choose a customer from each segment to ensure that there is no leaking of information that typically occurs when one vendor caters to two competing clients.



Suppliers, who in this model behave more and more similar to partners, also need to become more specialized, so they can not waste time and energy in understanding the multiple sectors of multiple customers.



10.Question 10

The interaction between Samsung and Apple is one of the examples in the new model of Customer Centric Selling, and the curious situation this model can foster. On the one hand, Samsung contributes to Apple's success by selling parts and components. On the other hand, the two companies compete in several segments, such as Tablets and Smartphones. This example demonstrates that:



--The model allows new business arrangements, more complex and beneficial to both parties. It is a matter of making appropriate trade agreements that protect the parties.



The model does not work unless suppliers commit to not going into businesses that can compete directly with customers.



The model allows new business arrangements, more complex and beneficial to both parties. It's a matter of noticing that the market has changed and that information leakage is inevitable.



The model does not work, and the knowledge vendors need to receive from customers will certainly be used in competing for product development.



11.Question 11

The financial pressure for results has several effects for the companies leadership. One is the increasing need to control labor costs. Many companies are being forced to lay off older and more experienced employees and replace them with younger people with lower wages and greater familiarity with technology. The implication that this exchange of personnel generates for suppliers/partners is:



--The need for suppliers/partners to support these younger teams with knowledge and experience.



The reduction in overall business profitability, which leads to the need for suppliers/partners to integrate forward.



The reduction of the overall profitability of the business, which shows that this model is not sustainable.



A needs of suppliers/partners to take on a large part of customers' responsibilities.
