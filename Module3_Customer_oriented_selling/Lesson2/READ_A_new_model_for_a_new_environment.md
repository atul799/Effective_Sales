**A new model for a new environment**



The Customer Centric Selling can take many formats. One of the ways one can actually see how such philosophy can be observed is the Key Account Management.



The Key Account Management model is based on realization that the firm’s management needs to understand the client, the market and its players. That knowledge allows one’s firm to build solid strategies and action plans. Implementation, on the other hand, requires that everyone and all the areas involved understand the strategy and work in a coordinated fashion to implement it.



The account management structure has the following elements:



**1) Account managers.** They are responsible for building and maintaining the relationship with the key clients. The Key Account Managers are the people with the most complete understanding on what actions needs to be done to support the client and what internal resources should be mobilized. Sometime, key clients are large international companies, with multiple levels - global, regional, national and sub-regional (or state). In this situation, the supplier usually benefits from the mirroring of this organization.



**2) Functional structures**. These areas are specialized in their areas of operation (marketing, finance, product development, production, etc.), and serve all account managers in their actions to support the Key Accounts. This kind of organization is normally organized as a matrix. For example, the head of Marketing is specialized in managing the whole Marketing organization, making sure the Marketing staff has the set of competences necessary to perform complex tasks on behalf of the firm. The head of Marketing also supports the firm’s overall Marketing needs, like those not related to support the Key Accounts.



**3) Geographic division.** These structures can be replicated at each level (global, regional, national and state), and does not always follow strict geographical divisions, as they may also be divided according to cultural and market similarities, market potential etc.





**The operation**



The operation of the Key Account Management works as a Matrix.

**1)** The manager of each of the key accounts is responsible for drawing up the strategic plan for his account, based on the overall strategic planning for each company, and mobilizes the areas that need to be supported. It is ideal that the specialized areas (Marketing, Competitive Intelligence, Operations etc.) contribute with their knowledge and experience in the elaboration of the account’s strategic planning process.



**2)** Each account has a team and, except account managers, members are often a part of multiple accounts. For example, a team may have the following elements: Account Manager, Category Manager, Intelligence, Market Research, Controlling, Customer Support, and Product Development. Each of these people is responsible for mobilizing the resources of their respective areas of activity.



**3)** There should be a single template model common to all the accounts. A single template ensures that all managers use the same processes and tools in which critical account information is registered:

a. Information on the competitive environment: opportunities, threats;

b. Information on the contacts within the client: decision makers, influencers, decision-making processes;

c. Status of ongoing processes and negotiation;

d. How the Key Account leaders perceive the market, their competitors and themselves;

e. Values, beliefs;

f. Capabilities;

g. Current and future strategies;

h. Internal processes;

i. Historical records of all the interactions between the firm and the customer.



**4)** Each area involved in managing the account has access to the area that contains the information it need to perform their activities, no more and no less; not too soon and not too late.

Access is granted according to each individual profiles, based on each one’s role, responsibility and need to know. This precaution is necessary to mitigate the risk of information leakage. For example, each account manager should access only the information relative to the operations under his/her responsibility.



**5)** The process is designed to also serve as a follow-up system for major projects;



**6)** The system can be interconnected to other tools. For example, a good supporting tool for the Key Account Management can be connected to LinkedIn, so as to facilitate access to the client’s employee information and to Salesforce or any other Sales management support system.



**7)** The precise follow-up is performed regularly – for example, monthly, quarterly or annual basis. According to the results of the follow-ups, the strategies and actions plan may be adapted, if necessary;



**8)** If the client expresses the need of a solution that cannot be solved with the supplier’s internal resources, the account manager can suggest a solution involving multiple external vendors.



The success of this kind of operation depends on several factors: communication and openness with both the client and between the internal areas, the ability to work as a team, technical knowledge, project management, conflict resolution and excellent business acumen and business analysis. Also, one of the most important factors it the complete commitment from the higher management.



This model changes the relationship with customers.
