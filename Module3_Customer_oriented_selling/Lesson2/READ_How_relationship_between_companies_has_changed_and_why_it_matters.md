**How the relationship between companies has changed and why it matters**

The changes in the market led to a significant increase in the competitiveness of the market as a whole and generated new forms of relationship between customers and suppliers, aimed at a long-term relationship.



With the Customer Centric Selling, the relationship between suppliers and customers has changed considerably. Suppliers aim to help customers achieving their goals, solving problems and meeting their needs.



The communication between suppliers and customers is less focused on negotiating prices and more focused on the discussion and resolution of customers' problems. Most of the contacts between suppliers and clients will feature a discussion on how the supplier can help the customer, not a presentation in which the supplier tries to promote the products and services they provide. By establishing an open dialogue, customers/suppliers often come up with a solution that involves elements that the suppliers do not have in their product portfolio.



The focuses on solving the client’s problem have several implications to the suppliers, in terms of their ability to develop solutions and work together with other suppliers and the customers. It increases access to sensitive information from clients and other suppliers. It requires an increased capacity to understand the client’s perspective from the strategic, tactical and operational level.



The ability to develop solutions and work together with suppliers and clients have a profound implication on the way the firm is organized. As the firm can no longer afford to keep on looking only at internal operations, but it needs to be far more aware of the market situation and its probable evolution, to develop knowledge and technologies to remain relevant.

Besides understanding the market, companies' managers and professionals will need to learn how to work on projects with multiple external players. They'll also have to develop the ability to interact with them without leaking vital information on their technology and plans on unrelated areas and establish processes to prevent sensitive information from one client to go to another client. This process is especially important when dealing with two clients that are fierce competitors.



The fact companies will have increased access to each other’s sensitive information will force them to develop new and effective ways to segregate information. This process may seem contradictory, but it's not.

Companies' professionals will be involved in multiple projects from multiple external players, and each of them must share information to guarantee the success of the endeavor. As they work together, there is an increased level of interactions, thus fostering the conditions for information leakage.

Not all information should be shared, and companies should share all information necessary for the completion of the project, no more and no less. For example, Coca-Cola works together with multiple suppliers, sharing information on plans and receiving inputs and support from them. But Coca-Cola does not share the Coca-Cola formula.



The need to really understand the client’s perspective grows in direct proportion with the increased complexity of the market. Globalization has played a major role in increasing the complexity of the analysis.



Companies tend to behave more rationally when they understand the competitors they are facing. When they do not know their competitor, their actions have the tendency to be exaggerated.
