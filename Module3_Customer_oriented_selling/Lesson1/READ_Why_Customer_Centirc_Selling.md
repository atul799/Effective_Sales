**Why customer centric selling**



Customer Centric Selling is important because it increases the competitiveness and likelihood of survival and success of companies in very competitive business environments. The competition level has been intensified by the combined effects of globalization, technological advancements in all the areas of knowledge, especially information and communication technologies.



In the past, companies were relatively safe in their local markets. As there were no easy ways to access information from distant markets, there was no way to compare prices and quality parameters from companies located in other States or other countries. Globalization and the technological advances eliminated that protection and transactions costs have dropped and access to information was facilitated.



The nature of the competition became truly global.



On the other hand, the consumers have access to more information on products and services worldwide, making them more price sensitive and more demanding regarding quality, which translates into enormous pressure in all industries.



The practical result is a reduction in the most of the industries’ profitability. The reduced profitability caused many companies to become unable to operate profitably because the reduced margins would require significantly larger volumes, to generate Economies of Scale that would enable companies to return to profitability. That is one of the reasons the markets started to consolidate. The consolidation of customers, competitors, suppliers, increased their bargaining power and increased the competitiveness of the market even further, leading companies to look for ways to improve their competitiveness.



Managers in companies have adopted a business model in which they are increasingly more specialized regarding their competitive positioning, and this approach aims to deal with the new business environment. In the previous video, the discussion exemplified how Apple controls a vast supply chain so that it can focus on its core activity, which is designing great products with easy-to-use features. This model is different from Apple’s business model in the 1990s, in which Apple manufactured even the printing cables.



In addition to the increase in specialization, the pressure for financial results has led many companies to replace their older employees with younger and lower salaried employees. Companies that have gone through this process have realized that young professionals find it easier to deal with technology, but the lack of personal and professional experience is a challenge. In many cases, suppliers were called upon to assist in solving problems that companies would take a long time to solve, due to the lack of experience of the staff.



As many companies' managers decided to focus on their core businesses and to leave secondary activities to other specialized companies, they act as integrators, coordinating complex value systems. In this model, companies prefer to partner with organizations that can help solve more complex problems. There are operational and financial advantages in this type of arrangement.



In this model, the supplier seeks to solve customer problems and to integrate more with its value generation processes. Increasing integration makes switching suppliers more expensive and more difficult.
