## Customer centric selling model explained



Customer Centric Selling is a model in which customer relationships are focused on solving customer problems more comprehensively and establishing a long-term relationship.



The fact that this model is based on the premise that it is important to focus on solving the client's problems implies changes in the behavior of the companies because the needs of the clients are complex and change as quickly as their market environment. Developing and offering solutions involves products and services from multiple suppliers, that is, what your firm offers is only a part of the solution.



Basically, it’s about facilitating the life of the clients. Rewrite your processes and systems to make the customer’s experiences better and more positive, promoting the relationship and make your customer recommend your company to other potential clients.



This model requires that your company genuinely understand the needs of customers, their processes, how they will use the solutions you present, and what pressures they feel. A complete solution demands different skills and new business practices.



Apple's operation can well exemplify this model. In a typical Apple device, about 90% of the internal components are developed by outside suppliers, which incorporate the solutions to the product Apple sells.



However, Apple appropriates approximately 50% of the profits. The model is great for Apple because it allows it to focus on the core business, design great products, and offer easy-to-use features. The benefit to suppliers is the large volume purchased by Apple and Apple's reputation for innovation, which gives suppliers a strong market position. In this way, linking their destiny with Apple protects the suppliers against market fluctuations.



On the other hand, failure to meet Apple's significant demands could mean the end of the contract. Even a company like Samsung gets great advantages from the relationship with Apple. On the one hand provides parts to Apple, on the other, it sells products that compete with Apple products. The benefit is that the large volume of parts helps Samsung to pay offset the fixed cost, allowing the selling of great product at a lower cost.



This example shows how the fate of participating companies in an industry is getting more and more intertwined.



This relationship model implies in a deeper involvement of your firm and, considering that the resources are limited, you must make sure your company concentrates its efforts on those clients with whom your company can generate value for both parts. This kind of match can only happen when both companies’ value chain, both yours and the clients are complimentary.



It has many similarities with a marriage – it is a long-term commitment, and the only real chance of success is when the involved stakeholders share values and both realize, respect and understand the differences. The partnership will only work as both companies together are better than alone.



The Customer Centric Selling model is not designed to offer charity to the clients. Instead, it was designed to increase the company's competitive advantage, improving both the top line and bottom line. It aims to focus on the most attractive clients, regarding revenues and profits, increase the retention rate. The net result is an increase in the financial value of the transactions coupled with a reduction in the total cost of dealing with the clients. Also, the model generates a more sustainable string of revenues and profits, thus making the firm more resilient to the fluctuations of the market.



Customer Centric Selling focuses on the most attractive clients, because every firm has finite resources, and some of them may give the company a competitive advantage if used properly. It is saying “yes” to the most promising opportunities and saying no to all others. By focusing on the most attractive clients, the firm can develop solutions specifically designed to serve the best interest of the client, thus making it more rational to continue with the current supplier instead of looking for alternatives.



The increased retention rate reduces the need for the firm to look for new clients. As the company’s operation becomes more integrated with that of its customers, operational costs can be reduced. Since the effort to win a new client is 5-6 times bigger than keeping a current one, all the time saved can be used to understand and satisfy the current clients’ needs, instead of finding new ones.



The transition to a Customer Centric Selling is not only a sales technique. If you treat it as one, your efforts will fail. Instead, it is a new way to organize the company and requires efforts and investments in various areas of the business. It also demands the development of human, technical and commercial competences. Your company will need the ability to understand the market from your client’s perspective, strategical, tactical and operational. The information will need to flow more quickly and effectively between the various departments of your firm and between your company and your clients.



The Customer Centric Selling model can be applied in both B2B and the B2C sales. The main difference is that the B2C operation requires the ability to handle larger volumes of information from multiple clients – the number can reach millions of end consumers. However, the concept is precisely the same. It is select those clients you will serve and set up a long-term relationship.



Customer Centric Selling model became more relevant due to the market changes towards more integration and concentration between different companies.

And this shift generated a more demanding and challenging competitive environment. We will return to this issue in our next session.
