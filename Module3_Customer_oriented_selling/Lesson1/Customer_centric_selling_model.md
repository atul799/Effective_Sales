The fact that this model is based on the premise that it is **important to focus on solving the client's problems implies changes in the behavior of companies, because the needs are complex and change as quickly as their market environment.** 

Developing and offering solutions often involves products and services from multiple vendors. That is, your firm is only part of the solution. **This model requires that your firm deeply understand the needs of the customers, their processes, how they will use the solutions you present, and what pressures they feel.**

More complete solutions demand different skills and new business practices. 



This model can be well exemplified by Apple's operation. In a typical Apple device, about 90% of the internal components are developed by outside vendors, which incorporate their solution to the product Apple sells. However, Apple appropriates about 50% of their profits. This model is great for Apple because it allows the company to focus on the core business, design great products, and offer easy-to-use features. The benefit to suppliers is that the large volume purchased by Apple, and the fact that Apple has a great reputation for innovation, gives suppliers a strong market position. In this way, linking their destiny with that of Apple protect the suppliers against market fluctuations. On the other hand, failure to meet Apple's big demands could mean the end of the contract. Even a large company like Samsung gets great advantages from their relationship with Apple. On one hand, it provides parts to Apple and on the other, Samsung sells products that compete against Apple products. The benefit is that the large volume of parts help to offset the fixed costs allowing Samsung to sell products at a lower cost. This example shows how the fate of participating companies in a given industry is becoming more and more intertwined. This model became a market trend towards integration and concentration.
