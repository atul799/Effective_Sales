Companies that can't adapt are being bought or being forced out of the market. The market tends to become more and more consolidated, and the business environment becomes increasingly more aggressive. 

To deal with this new environment, companies have adopted a business model in which they
are increasingly more specialized. In the previous lecture, we talked about how Apple controls a huge supply chain. So we can focus on this end activity, designing great products with easy to use features. This model is different from Apple's business model in the 90s, in which Apple manufactured pretty much
everything, including printing cables.

Companies that have gone through this process have realized that young professionals find it easier to deal with technology. But they lack the professional and experience, and that problem is a challenge. In many cases, vendors who are called upon to assist in solving problems that companies would not be able to solve, or would take a very long time, due to the lack of experience from their staff. 

Many companies have chosen to focus on their core activities, and leave secondary activities to more specialized companies and they begin to act as managers of more complex valued systems, acting as integrators.
