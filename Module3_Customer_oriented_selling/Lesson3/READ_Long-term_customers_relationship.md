Implications of the Customer Centered Sales to the relationship with clients



The main implication of this management model is the cooperative nature of this relationship, in direct opposition to the buying and selling of commodities.



Each account management team needs to have a deep understanding on the client’s **business, strategies and operations**. The whole team needs to understand the client’s **competitive environment, how business environment variables influence the customer's business, its advantages and disadvantages relative to competitors, strategies and business operation**. This knowledge should be used to support the client’s success.



All companies face very challenging business environments, which forces them to adapt to survive, upon the realization that the traditional business models are not adequate because they lack the flexibility and ability to maintain the relationship with key clients, as they change their needs according to the needs of their businesses.



Some of the forces below exemplify how your client's business environment presents challenges.



Technology: The accelerated advancement of technology allows the birth and growth of various industries, while destroying others. For example, technology has enabled the development of shared transportation applications, reducing the demand for taxis. The trend towards shared transportation has led to the downfall of several taxi cooperatives in Brazil. At the same time, the apps to facilitate shared transportation generated thousands of employment opportunities around the world.



Merger and Acquisitions: Many companies simply will not survive in an increasingly more competitive environment. They may lack the managerial skills, access to technology, capital or the scale to compete. As the competitive environment grows more aggressive, merger and acquisition are inevitable. These mergers and acquisitions increase concentration in the industry, and increase the bargaining power of surviving companies thus making the competitive environment even more challenging. As the trend ripples through the industry, suppliers, clients, competitors become bigger and more competitive, forcing the smaller players out of the market as they become less able to generate the margins they need and want.



Increased investors pressure on financial results. The advancement of information and communication technologies has reduced the costs and complexity of managing the investment portfolio. As a result, investors are able to change their portfolio in pursuit of higher yields, forcing companies to generate results in the short term.



Increased demand from the final consumer. Whenever the final consumer becomes more demanding in terms of quality and sensitivity to price, there is a pressure for improved performance that ripples through the entire value chain. For example, as the final consumers become more price sensitive, they put pressure on Walmart, which will in turn transfers the pressure to soap manufacturers.



A deeper understanding of the customer and its business environment allows a more mature dialogue in which one can better understand the customer's perspective and identify how one’s firm can help.



A deeper level of cooperation and understanding lead to greater access to information on client’s strategies, operations and other factors, therefore the suppliers need to make sure they have the ability to protect the interests of the clients. For example, if two account management teams work for two direct competitors, they should ensure that there are no information leaks that would harm both companies.



Another important issue that the change caused by this business model brings to one’s firm is the increased importance of Corporate Compliance, to make sure all employees are guided by high standards of integrity and corporate ethics. A functional, organizational-wide Compliance program not only prevents all kinds of legal consequences that may negatively affect your business but also helps to reassure the firm’s customers on the fact the information will be handled properly.
