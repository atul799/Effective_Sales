Strategic sales management has been around for a long time, but we need to understand it,
to get it just right. 

The greek word strategos refers to the general of the Greek army. The guy who choose the battle ground,choose where to fight the enemy, and choose how lay out his army, to get the best possible advantage in battle.

 At the beginning of the 20th century, **Henry Ford** created the model T, a black car, only black,
which he wanted to sell to every American. **A car for every man**. Why was it black? Because black paint dries faster than any other color. He actually used the planks from the crates to create the flooring of the car. He integrated component crates that brought in the parts. He used that to make
the flooring of the car. **He integrated a very strong value chain to support strategy of lowest possible cost. The cost leader in the new car industry, and he dominated that for several decades**. 

Some time later, **Alfred Sloan** at GM invented **market segmentation**, his vision was **a car for every pocket**. So he created divisions that built Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Chevrolet,catering to different tastes and different levels of income who could buy different cars. He created **the concept of segmentation,a strategy of differentiation, and selling different products to each market segment**. 

After the Second World War in the 1950s, we found ourselves in the new age, optimistic, divers, young, rock and roll, Elvis Presley's, Beatles, Rolling Stones. John F Kennedy in the 60s,Martin Luther King. We felt that we could reach the moon,and we did. We felt that we could dream big,
and we did. New thinking in strategy obviously came up during this time. 

**Alfred Chandler** became very famous. In 1962, he wrote a book showing that the
**company structure must follow a strategy. You must have find a strategy and
then organize the company**. 

**Igor Ansoff** in 1965 showed that **in times of fast change, new strategies are needed. The company needed to be fast,quick, and identify new strategies**. 

**Peter Drucker** wrote many, many books. One of them in 1967 was **The Age of Discontinuity, how to manage in turbulent times**. 

More recently, at the turn of the century, the modern management guru, from Harvard Business School, shows **a distinctive unique strategy is needed for a company to create a competitive advantage. It brings in the lifeblood of the company.**

The money paid by the client is the oxygen of the organization. Without that oxygen, the company dies. So strategy is essential for your company to be competitive and to prosper. **Selling in alignment with strategy is fundamental to guarantee, prosperity and growth**. Strategic selling is the heart of success. So this specialization in strategic sales management is a fundamental building block in the development of your career and the success of your business.
