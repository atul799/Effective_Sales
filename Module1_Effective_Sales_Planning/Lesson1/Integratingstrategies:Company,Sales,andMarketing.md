## Integrating strategies: Company, Sales, and Marketing

In the past years, the economy has shifted from a manufacturing-oriented to a marketing-oriented approach. The impact of this change is that managers don`t design the product applying a manufacturer's view of the process. Instead, they do it by researching carefully what potential customers demand.

The change also impacts how managers design the commercial structure, marketing, sales, and promotions of the products or services. Only after these steps will managers develop the production, manufacturing and sourcing processes to make the goods and to structure the services development and delivery.

In this process, it's clear that marketing and sales functions increased a lot in importance. From a strategic perspective, it's completely different from the previous approach.

In the previous approach, marketing and sales functions were more focused on pushing the sales, while in the new approach marketing and sales focus on analyzing how the markets will pull the demand of products and services, and therefore designing the products and services accordingly to the potential demand.

This discussion doesn't mean marketing and sales functions didn't have relevance before. It only emphasizes that in the past the importance was on the need to sell the already made goods; while in the new approach the importance in on the need to identify what the demand is, aiming to offer the right products and services.

Within this context, under this strategic guidance, all aspects of the business should be integrated. Otherwise, the goals may not be achieved.

The consequence of such strategic orientation is that the system of operations of the company mobilizes the areas towards customer satisfaction.

The role of sales is crucial because the integration demands to put the philosophy into action, which means applying foresight view, marketing research, products and services portfolio planning, sales forecasting, advertising, incentive models, distribution, sales performance analysis, monitoring, controlling and feedback.

This path of processes clearly illustrates the transition from strategy to sales results analysis, which highlights the integration between strategy and sales function.

It also emphasizes the link between marketing and sales. If these areas integrate to a high level, the better for the company in the transition from strategy to sales.

One essential characteristic of an approach that is market-oriented is the fact that personal selling plays a fundamental role in companies that apply this approach. Managers should apply all their efforts to address sales teams’ development in this context.

Also important is the fact that the strategic guidelines give the directions for the company, and these directions may include some key performance indicators. At the strategic level, corporations establish corporate goals related to cash flow and earnings, which inspires corporate executives to define goals like EBITDA margin, expected cash flow or earnings per share.

These suggested examples of goals lead executives to establish revenue goals at the business level (the company level).

Revenues are the drivers to support the corporate goals at the strategic level. And what are the drivers of the revenue?



**Products and services**

The portfolio of products and services are the drivers of revenue, and to generate revenue, they must be sold. As simple as that.

Here we have the undeniable proof that sales function is one of the top issues in businesses. And to perform at high level in sales, managers need the support of a system planned to give the tools, arguments, incentive program, and adequate communication and distribution to serve the potential customers. In other words, sales function needs marketing function.

Marketing, by its turn, is a function that needs assumptions to be developed. And a great deal of the assumptions come from the strategic level of the company. Consequently, marketing needs strategic guidelines, and then the transition path of Strategy, Marketing and Sales is demonstrated in this discussion.



**Flexible integration**

Up to this point, it’s important to remember that the strategic planning process doesn`t mean an inflexible plan. Managers can adopt an emerging strategy that was not in the original plan. Mintzberg (1994) has proposed this approach, and one of the examples he used to argue in favor of it relates to the sales area. He points that a salesperson can have the initiative to sell an existing product to new customers, and during the time, salespeople who have contact with this salesperson start doing the same. The consequence is the company develops a whole new market without this strategy being even roughly planned.

Also, the link between strategy and sales function should be emphasized in the planning process, and in a way that the resulting sales strategy means working smarter, not working harder. Sales strategy should focus on customers and approaches to support them in the sales decision (Rackham, 1989).

A final word to emphasize the topics of this reading material:

Managers should make efforts to integrate strategy, marketing and sales to generate a seamless-like sales strategy plan. Maybe the plan will not be complete; however, it will give them the appropriate conditions to make the most from the sales plan, and also be able to capture emerging opportunities that might come in the future.
