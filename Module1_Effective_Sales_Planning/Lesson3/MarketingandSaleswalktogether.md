#### Marketing and Sales walk together

We have an extremely important
subject to discuss in this section,**the alignment and
integration between sales and marketing**. In 2006, **Kotler, Rackham, and
Krishnaswamy** wrote an article and brought to light the eternal fight between
sales and marketing in corporations. Which does not mean that there is a simpler
integration among all other areas of the organization. However, this classic of
the corporate universe, the clash between sales and marketing,
is one of the biggest culprits in the failure to disseminate and
implement corporate strategy. The authors compared sales and
marketing to Capulets and Montagues, but
we know the end of the story, doesn't it? Even when Romeo and
Juliet promised eternal love for themselves, there is death in the end,
and worse, the death of the corporate strategy
which could be the compass that walks the company through the market
battle to accomplish their results. We can view the parallel between this
eternal love and company's strategy. If sales and
marketing just can't be good friends, be like my good friends,
can't talk like good friends. Walk together as friends, and/or even live in respect to the other,
with their respective importance in their organization structures, there is
no way to corporate strategy survive. Companies need to go further and establish
an integration between these areas, to promote synergy and
focus on the business strategy, not on the process or
these functional relationships. To achieve this objective, it's necessary
to define and align marketing and sales, establishing responsibilities, activities,
and roles for each area clearly. Make us place both value it, and significance of these two drivers for
the business. The first step is to determine
the relationship stats to develop and straighten the link between the areas. In the same article,
which we mentioned in the beginning, and have recommended as a read for
this lesson. We'll find a very organized table to guide
us in terms of determined relationship status between these two areas. As you can see by my side,
by defining status and knowing the right degree of
interconnection, companies are more likely to draw a better way to track their
most pressing business challenge. In some extreme situations, crafting a new relationship between
both areas is the ideal solution. However, it requires a strong leadership,
and establishment of a whole new culture, which sometimes
needs to be built from scratch. Aligned with this concept,
one or the other is liable for developing this sense of duty and
work for the same goals. Both the areas have their
own responsibilities, but still have the same corporate
objectives to pursue.
