Why did Ford follow a strategy of mass production?



**Because at that time the economy was in a manufacturing-oriented strategy**



Because the ongoing ways-of-doing things at the time were based on mass production



Because Ford didn't know if the market would accept his concept of the product



Because no other entrepreneurs had the insight before him

Correct. At the time Ford idealized the Model T, he saw that the potential demand was there, but the product wasn't.

8.Question 8

What is the best strategic insight that Sloan had at the time he was at General Motors?



**People are different from each other; therefore, their preferences are different**



He aimed to solve the problem of the scale of production



Sloan proved Ford's approach was wrong



Sloan didn't have a strategic insight

Correct. His insight was about market segmentation, which changed a lot the way marketing professionals analyzed potential customers

9.Question 9

Does segmentation matter for sales planning?



It depends on what is the business of the company



Not at all! At the end of the day, it's all about sales volumes, and it depends on the demand, not on the segmentation



**Absolutely! Segmentation influences sales planning in various aspects: (1) selling argumentation; (2) sales training; (3) post-sales customer services, to mention only a few items**



No. Sales planning is a function that relies mostly on what salespeople have to say about the demand

Correct. The segmentation defines how the sales planning is structured and implemented.

10.Question 10

What is the relationship between what Igor Ansoff proposed and the shift in the economy from a manufacturing-oriented to a market-oriented?



Ansoff proposed his ideas much later than the shift in the economy, so there's no point in associating the topics



There's no relation between these two topics



Ansoff was focused on the economic aspects, and they are not related to the topics of the question, which are about strategy



**The nature of the relationship is straightforward: In a broad economic sense, people started to base their purchasing decisions on their preferences and requirements**

Correct. They started to decide based on their preferences and needs, and not based on the availability of the product as is. In other words, a change in purchasing behavior was on the go.

11.Question 11

Which of the statements below describes the difference between manufacturing-oriented and market-oriented approach?



In market-oriented approach, marketing and sales functions are very relevant, due to the responsibility to identify what is desired by customers. In manufacturing-oriented approach, marketing and sales functions are not as relevant, because customers don't have much choice.



In manufacturing-oriented approach, marketing and sales functions are extremely relevant, due to the responsibility to sell what might not be desired by customers. In market-oriented approach, marketing and sales functions are not as relevant



Analyzing this difference is not worth because there's no possibility of these two approaches be adopted by companies in the same business.



**In manufacturing-oriented approach, marketing and sales functions were more focused on pushing the sales, while in the market-oriented approach, marketing and sales focus on analyzing how the markets will pull the demand of products and services**

Correct. The first approach is based on pushing the sales, and the latter approach is based on market-pull accordingly to what customers demand

12.Question 12

Which of the statements below DOES NOT relate to the market-oriented approach?



Managers have to apply sales forecasting, advertising, incentive models, and distribution analysis.



Managers have to apply a foresight process and marketing research.



Managers have to apply sales performance analysis, monitoring, controlling and feedback.



**In the market-oriented approach, sales managers need to plan sales considering the competitors don't apply a manufacturing-oriented approach.**

Correct. There may be competitors that apply the manufacturing-oriented approach, and they can harm the company's sales due to their operational scale. Remember, a manufacturing-oriented company can produce exactly what is demanded by customers. Don't ever forget this detail.

13.Question 13

Personal selling skills matter in a market-oriented approach. Would you support the same statement for the manufacturing-oriented approach?



**Yes, because if the manufacturing-oriented company's portfolio includes products that are not exactly what customers demand, selling these products becomes challenging.**



No, because the personal selling skills are not needed in the case of a company that follows the manufacturing-oriented approach. In these companies, the products are more like commodities.



No. In the manufacturing-oriented approach personal selling skills are not relevant.



No. Personal selling skills are crucial for market-oriented approach only.

Correct. Two companies may adopt different approaches, and yet they may have a hard time trying to sell their products because the market-oriented company may have come to wrong conclusions of what the customers demand, and the manufacturing-oriented company may have a product that is not exactly what is demanded by customers. Both contexts demand excellent personal selling skills.

14.Question 14

What is the connection between strategy, marketing and sales?



Incentives and compensation program are the links that connect the three functions.



**Revenues are the drivers to support the corporate goals at the strategic level. And revenues come from sold products and services, so they come from sales function. But sales need the support of a system planned to give the tools, arguments, incentive program, and adequate communication and distribution.In a nutshell, sales need marketing function.**



Salespeople are the connection between strategy, marketing, and sales.



The connection is materialized by the advertising function

Correct. The strategy defines corporate goals, which is represented by the revenues objectives. Revenues don't come if there are no sales, and sales don't come easily without a proper marketing function.

15.Question 15

Which of the statements below describes how sales strategy should be planned?



--Sales strategy should be planned by applying the corporate level objectives directly as sales goals and targets.



C: The link between strategy and sales function should be emphasized in the planning process, and in a way that the resulting sales strategy means working smarter, not working harder. Sales strategy should focus on customers and approaches to support them in the buying decision.



Selling is an operational function. There's no point in considering the strategy into sales.



Sales strategy should be planned by marketing professionals only, due to the biases that salespeople tend to present in the planning phase.

Incorrect. A typical corporate level objective doesn't apply well to the sales goals and targets establishment.
